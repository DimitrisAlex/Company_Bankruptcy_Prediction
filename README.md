**Abstract**
The prediction of company bankruptcy is a crucial task in
financial analysis, assisting stakeholders and investors make informed
decisions and mitigate risks. This thesis, explores the application of various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support
Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest
and Decision Tree, for predicting company bankruptcy, using financial
ratios derived from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the year 1999 to
2009 (Taiwanese Bankruptcy Prediction 2020). The results indicate that
logistic regression, when optimized and combined with techniques such
as SMOTE to address class imbalance, can provide robust predictions.
This work contributes to the field by demonstrating a practical approach
to bankruptcy prediction, highlighting key features, influencing company
solvency and offering insights for future research.
